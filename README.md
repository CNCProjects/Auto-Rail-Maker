Auto-Rail-Maker
===============

This is a bit of Shopbot code that will allow you to make rails for the large jig

This has been tested and verified working on a Handibot. Watch this video to see how it works:

With the code in here, and just a basic fence that you can make yourself for your Handibot, you can create a large material jig rail any size you want. This code cuts a V shape into the rail and then actually turns off the spindle, slides the rail down, and then continues the cut. You can actually feet any length of material through the Handibot and create rails as long as you need them.

This can be great if you have different setups that you want to keep in your shop.

If you want to see the rest of the accessories do you cane make your own mods, check out the Handibot Hardware GitHub:
